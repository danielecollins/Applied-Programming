# Overview

I spent 2 weeks learning the django web framework and creating this web app.

I built an app that allows you to search for a ticker symbol and get live ask and bid prices during market hours. To run the app you will need to have django and yfinance installed in a virtual environment. After installing those two libraries you will run `python manage.py runserver` in the terminal in the boohissbot directory.

I wrote this software because I wanted to learn django and I have wanted to build a stock trading bot so this is the start of that bot.

# Web Pages

I have two main pages that I've created. We have a homepage where we enter our time zone. The second page is the stock info page and this is where we can search for a stock and the current ask and bid prices will be displayed.

# Development Environment

I used python, django, html, and yfinance to develop this app.
