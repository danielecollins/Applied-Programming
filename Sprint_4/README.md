# Overview

In this project I did some data analysis on basketball stats that I collected from two of my intermural team's games. I collected many different stats but for this analysis I focused in on scoring.

* [Game 1 Data Set](player_stats_vs_bears.csv)
* [Game 2 Data Set](player_stats_vs_kyle_and_friends.csv)

*Note: I also included the Excel sheet that I used to gather the data in the repo, it's titled "Player Stats.xlsx"*

My purpose for writing this program was to learn more about how to do data anaylysis using python. I found that I really enjoyed this short project and I would like to do more projects like this in the future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

### Free throws
Q: Was there any improvement in free throw shooting between our first and second games?

A: No, we actually did worse in game 2

Q: Who drew the most foul shots in game 1?

A: Conner

Q: Who drew the most foul shots in game 2?

A: Nick

### Field Goals

Q: Who made the most 2 pointers in game 2?

A: Tyler

Q: Who made the most 3 pointers in game 1?

A: Walt

Q: Who made the most 3 pointers in game 2?

A: Walt

Q: Who had the best field goal percentage in game 1?

A: Alvaro

Q: Who had the best field goal percentage in game 2?

A: It was a tie between Walt and Conner but Walt shot 3 times as many shots as Conner did and all of his field goals made were three pointers whereas Conners were two pointers.

# Development Environment

I used Excel to gath my dataset. I used python and jupyter lab to write my code. I used the following python libraries to develop my graphs and dataframes; pandas, matplotlib, and numpy.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* I would like to do more graphs and totals for certain stats and check for corrilations between them.
* I would like to get player height and weight and see if there is any coorilation between  certain physical attributes and overall player rating.
* I would like to do more graphs on some of the other stats that I've tracked.
